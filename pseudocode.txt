while I haven't pressed an operator yet, 
every number I type, 
- the first digit should replace the output of the screen and then
- it should be added to the display if I keep typing numbers
- should be saved in result        

While I type an operator for the first time, 
    - it should be saved in memory,
    - Display doesn't change, it might just flick

    When I type equals, or the operator is typed for the second time, 
    - it should call the operate and
    - the result should appear on display replacing it
    - this result should be assigned as the first argument


set result to 0
set temp to 0
set operator to undefined

The display is 0

1. I type 2
    result is updated to 2
    The display is 2

2. I type 3
    in display is 23
    the result is updated to 23

3. I type +
    operator is set to +

4. I type 5
    23 is replaced by 5
    temp is updated to 5

5. I type 1
    in display is 51
    temp is updated to 51

6.1. Case 1:
    I type =
        result is updated to 74
        in display is 74
        operator is set to undefined

    I type +
        operator is set to +
    
6.2. Case 2:
    I type +
        result is updated to 74
        in display is 74
        operator is set to +

===============
by dafault the display is 0

we have three types:
    - number
    - +
    - =

First type number
    Second type +
        Third type number
        Third type =
    Second type =

First type +
    Second type number
    Second type =

First type =
    Second type number
    Second type +

======================
by default the display is 0

We have two types of buttons
    - number
    - operator

first type number
    second type number
        third type number
        third type operator
    second type operator
first type operator
    second type number
    second type operator

....

This is a very difficult app because it depends on so many things
There are different cases, such as the order

====
If I type number
type operator
type equal, 
it will apply that operator to that number
In other words, it will set temp equal to result

======
There are three options for me to type: a number, an operator, equals. 

You can only type one thing at a time. The order of things matters. 
Therefore, every step I should check for the previews steps. 

By default the result of the calculator is 0. 

I will call the first number 'result' and
the second number 'temp'.

There's an operate function which takes an operator and a temp and modifies the result

This function, every time it's called, it empties the temp and the operator. 

If I type a number:
    if I haven't typed an operator:
        Every number I type will be added to the result

    otherwise, 
        Every number I type will be added to the temp

If I type equal:
    If I haven't typed an operator:
        nothing will happen

    else, if I've typed an operator:
        I will call the operate function with the operation and the last number
    set operator to undefined

If I enter operator:
    if I have typed another operator and a number after:
        I will call the operate function with the operation and the last number on the previews result
    it will replace whatever operator is in memory
