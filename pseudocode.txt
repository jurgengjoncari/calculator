while I haven't pressed an operator yet, 
every number I type, 
- the first digit should replace the output of the screen and then
- it should be added to the display if I keep typing numbers
- should be saved in previews operand        

While I type an operator for the first time, 
    - it should be saved in memory,
    - Display doesn't change, it might just flick

    When I type equals, or the operator is typed for the second time, 
    - it should call the compute and
    - the previews operand should appear on display replacing it
    - this previews operand should be assigned as the first argument


set previews operand to 0
set current operand to 0
set operator to undefined

The display is 0

1. I type 2
    previews operand is updated to 2
    The display is 2

2. I type 3
    in display is 23
    the previews operand is updated to 23

3. I type +
    operator is set to +

4. I type 5
    23 is replaced by 5
    current operand is updated to 5

5. I type 1
    in display is 51
    current operand is updated to 51

6.1. Case 1:
    I type =
        previews operand is updated to 74
        in display is 74
        operator is set to undefined

    I type +
        operator is set to +
    
6.2. Case 2:
    I type +
        previews operand is updated to 74
        in display is 74
        operator is set to +

===============
by dafault the display is 0

we have three types:
    - number
    - +
    - =

First type number
    Second type +
        Third type number
        Third type =
    Second type =

First type +
    Second type number
    Second type =

First type =
    Second type number
    Second type +

======================
by default the display is 0

We have two types of buttons
    - number
    - operator

first type number
    second type number
        third type number
        third type operator
    second type operator
first type operator
    second type number
    second type operator

....

This is a very difficult app because it depends on so many things
There are different cases, such as the order

====
If I type number
type operator
type equal, 
it will apply that operator to that number
In other words, it will set current operand equal to previews operand

======
There are four options for me to type: a number (and dot), an operator, equals and clear. 

There is a display. By default it displays 0. 

You can only type one thing at a time. The order of things matters. 
Therefore, every step I should check for the previews steps. 

By default the current operand is 0. 

I will call the number I type, 'current operand' until I type an operator, then it's called 'previews operand'.

compute operator:
    based on the operator, will update the current operand with the previews operand
    set operator to undefined
    set previews operand to empty

append number:
    if I have typed an operator:
        set the previews operand equal to current operator
        set current operand to empty
    else:
        The digit will be appended to the current operand
    when I call this function, it will display the current operand to output


--Connecting to the DOM--

If I type a digit:
    call the append function

If I type equal:
    If I've typed an operator:
        I will call the compute function with the operation and the current operand

If I enter operator:
    if I have typed another operator and a number after:
        call the equal function 
    it will replace whatever operator is in memory

If I type clear:
    it will replace operator with undefined,
    it will replace previews operand with zero,
    it will set current operand as empty
