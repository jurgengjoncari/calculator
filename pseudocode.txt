while I haven't pressed an operator yet, 
every number I type, should appear in the display

While I type operators, the screen shouldn't change

While I type a number after the operator,
the first digit should replace the output of the screen and then
it should be added to the display

When I type equals, or an operator, 
it should call the operate and
the result should appear on display replacing it
this result should be assigned as the firs argument
