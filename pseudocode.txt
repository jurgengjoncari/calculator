There are four options for me to type: a number (and dot), an operator, equals and clear. 

There is a display. By default it displays 0. 

You can only type one thing at a time. The order of things matters. 
Therefore, every step I should check for the previews steps. 

By default the current operand is 0. 

I will call the number I type, 'current operand' until I type an operator, then it's called 'previews operand'.

compute operator:
    based on the operator, will update the current operand with the previews operand
    set operator to undefined
    set previews operand to empty

append number:
    if I have typed an operator:
        set the previews operand equal to current operator
        set current operand to empty
    else:
        The digit will be appended to the current operand
    when I call this function, it will display the current operand to output

If I type a digit:
    call the append function

If I type equal:
    If I've typed an operator:
        I will call the compute function with the operation and the current operand

If I enter operator:
    if I have typed another operator and a number after:
        call the equal function 
    it will replace whatever operator is in memory

If I type clear:
    it will replace operator with undefined,
    it will replace previews operand with zero,
    it will set current operand as empty
