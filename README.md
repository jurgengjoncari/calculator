This is a simple calculator that I created using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy to use with a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices. I created this project as a way to improve my JavaScript skills and to learn more about building interactive web applications.
