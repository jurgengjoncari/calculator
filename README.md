# Calculator

This is a very basic calculator: https://jurgengjoncari.github.io/calculator/

To do this project I've used ES6, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Bugs and improvements to be made eventually
- Try to compile all CSS into one file. 
- Fix the font in output so that it loads a fallback. 
- The digit font is not displayed in Safari. 
- Verify why the equals button doesn't change color on hover, and fix it. 
- For touch displays, when tapped, the button remains darker. 
- Add the clear screen button. 
- When typing some buttons consequently, such as decimal, backspace, etc., gives NaN. Maybe write some tests cases after fixing it. 
- When I type a function key from the keyboard, such as "F12", it is displayed in the calculator. 
- Polish the footer, maybe add the GitHub icon. 
- Make the font of the banner a bit more interesting. 
- Every time a button is typed, the output should flick. 
- Check the animations, such as the hover state, etc. 
- Fix colors; the blue is too purple; make the colors look good for dark mode. 
- Find a way to differentiate the output from the background.
