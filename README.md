# Calculator

This is a very basic calculator: https://jurgengjoncari.github.io/calculator/

To do this I've used classes - from ES6, and semantic HTML.

## Bugs and improvements to be made eventually:

- Add the delete button
- Check combination of some typing some buttons consequently, such as decimal, backspace, etc. Maybe write some tests cases. 
- When I type a function key from the keyboard, such as "F12", it is displayed in the calculator. 
- The digit font is not displayed in Safari. 
- Polish the footer, maybe add the GitHub icon. 
- Make the banner a bit more interesting. 
- Eventually, add scientific mode. 
- Every time a button is typed, the screen should flick. 
- Check the animations, such as the hover state, etc. 
- Fix colors: the blue and lime do not have the correct contrast with the black background. 
- When the result is too long, the whole calculator becomes a bit wider. 
- Find a way to differentiate the output from the background. 
- Make the colors look good for dark mode.
