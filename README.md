# Calculator

This is a very basic calculator: https://jurgengjoncari.github.io/calculator/

To do this I've used classes - from ES6, and semantic HTML.

## Bugs and improvements to be made eventually:

- Redesign the calculator completely. I do not like to treat it like the hand calculator, but just like the output of the calculations one might do by typing on the actual keyboard. Then, the virtual numpad is just like an accessory / help for those that don't use an actual keyboard. Think of it as the Wordle app. 
- Add the delete button
- Check combination of some typing some buttons consequently, such as decimal, backspace, etc. Maybe write some tests cases. 
- When I type a function key from the keyboard, such as "F12", it is displayed in the calculator. 
- The digit font is not displayed in Safari. 
- Polish the footer, maybe add the GitHub icon. 
- Make the banner a bit more interesting. 
- Eventually, add scientific mode. 
- Every time a button is typed, the screen should flick. 
- Check the animations, such as the hover state, etc. 
- Fix colors: the blue and lime do not have the correct contrast with the black background. 
- When the result is too long, the whole calculator becomes a bit wider. 
- Find a way to differentiate the output from the background. 
- Make the colors look good for dark mode.
